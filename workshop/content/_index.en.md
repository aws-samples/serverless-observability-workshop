# AWS Serverless Observability Workshop

Welcome! In this workshop, we will explore some of the techniques you can adopt to monitor your Serverless applications using AWS services by leveraging the proper operational and business metrics, standardized and centralized logging and orchestrating traces throughout your application code and other services.

# Important

Each workshop module is designed to be completely independent without depending on the previous module completion, except for the `Prerequisites`. In this way, you can plan your day/event to accomplish or deliver the entire workshop or specific modules that capture your attention.
