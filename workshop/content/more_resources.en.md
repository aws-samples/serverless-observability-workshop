#### More Workshops

* [AWS Wild Rydes Serverless Workshops](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-serverless-workshops) - This repository contains a collection of workshops and other hands on content that will guide you through building various serverless applications using AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Step Functions, Amazon Kinesis, and other services. The following workshops are available: **Web Application, Auth, Data Processing, DevOps, Image Processing, Multi Region, Security and Machine Learning.**
* [Monolith to Serverless SaaS Workshop](https://decompose-monolith.serverlessworkshops.io/) In this workshop, we’ll start with a traditional monolithic architecture for a working sample application. Then, we’ll progressively migrate the elements of the single-tenant monolithic architecture to a modern multi-tenant solution. This will include moving to a modern web application, introducing the API Gateway, decomposing the application tier into serverless microservices.

#### Tools for AWS Lambda, Serverless Applications and CI/CD Pipelines

* [AWS SAM Local](https://github.com/thoeni/aws-sam-local) - AWS CLI tool for managing Serverless applications written with AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM). SAM Local can be used to test functions locally, start a local API Gateway from a SAM template, validate a SAM template, and generate sample payloads for various event sources.
* [cfn-lint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cfn-lint) - A more friendly CloudFormation JSON and YAML Validator.
* [Snyk](https://snyk.io/product/) - Automatically detect open source vulnerabilities and accelerate fixing throughout your development process.
